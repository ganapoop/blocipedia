# Blocipedia: A Wiki Collaboration Tool

## Blocipedia has the abilities to:

* create a new standard user account with an email address and password
* edit existing wikis that are public as a standard user
* upgrade to premium status so you can create public and private wikis, delete wikis you've created, and add collaborators to wikis you've created.
* downgrade back from a premium to a standard user, which makes all of your private wikis become public
* delete your user account, which deletes any wikis you created
 * create, edit, or delete any wiki as an admin
 * use markdown via the redcarpet gem
